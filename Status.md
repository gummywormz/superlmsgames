### 1/4/2020

Super LMSGames is restarting development on Monday. Two maps are like 60% complete. Most of the earlier concepts are either incomplete or not up to quality standards

### Concepts that are ready for mapping:

* Ice climbers is a generic climbing maps with events like yetis, wind and avalanches

* Ghost busters where you explore a giant mansion and kill ghosts. If you "die" you become a ghost yourself and attack other players. If there is one human left there comes a super ghost and it attacks the player. Possibly make it so the player ghosts can control different parts of the ghost??

* Pokemon go where you need to capture pokemon with a phone. Phone blocks most of the view and slows you down. You must dodge robbers and cars etc. Try to figure out if its possible to have stuff display for the player if they have an item etc. Try to figure out a method around chase cam??

* Endless stairs where you dodge obstacles on a moving stair case.

* Hornet man map where you water plants to attack enemies. Big center enemy that can kill lots of players activates either on the last person to water or the person to water the most. Go to areas where lots of plants are for water

* AAAAAA mode where its AAAAAA but the map chances so it becomes half hit enemies and half move to the next section of the map properly

### Concepts that need more concepting

* Heatah Fajita where its DM but with bad weapons. Need bad weapon ideas

* Magnet golf?

* Splatoon?

* Bomber man??

* Mega Man dreams collection like the sonic feeding eggman minigame. Need ideas for events

* Severe storms where it rains outside and you have to stay inside. Need incentive to go inside other than weapons maybe

* Doggame where you must pet dogs and events occur. Need event ideas.

### Note about open testing

Open testing was mixed last time. People are still tight lipped about feedback but it did help with maps that were immediate failures. 
On the other hand I felt it took away from the full release of the game as there wasn't enough difference between RC / betas / full release that kept players interested.
